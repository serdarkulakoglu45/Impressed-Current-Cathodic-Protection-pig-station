# Impressed Current Cathodic Protection (ICCP) Simulation

This repository contains a Python simulation for Impressed Current Cathodic Protection systems for pig stations in pipelines.

## Overview

The simulation models the cathodic protection system for a pipeline pig station, including:
- Pig launcher and receiver sections
- Underground pipeline
- MMO-Ti anodes placement and performance

The project compares an original design with an optimized design to demonstrate improvements in protection coverage and efficiency.

## Features

- Simulation of original and optimized anode placement designs
- Visualization of potential distribution in soil environment
- Current distribution analysis
- Protection metrics calculation and comparison
- Interactive plots with hover functionality for detailed inspection

## Results

The simulation generates several visualizations:
- Station layout with anode placement
- Soil CP potential distribution
- Current flow patterns
- Protection potential distribution along the pipeline

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
